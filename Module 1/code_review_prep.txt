1. Who performs a code review?
Someone other than the author(s) of a piece of code.

2. What are 4 important things to do in a code review? (see second link at bottom of page in bold)
- Review every line of code being asked to review
- Look at the context of the code to see if it is within scope and does what it is required to do
- Make sure you're improving code health
- Compliment developers on good things that they do
 
3. When performing a code review, most people create a checklist of what they will be looking for in the code. Please type at least 3 things you will be looking for in the Login UI. (third link is an example of a code review checklist for a more complicated project, but you can pick and choose from the things on this list that are more relevant to the Login UI.)
